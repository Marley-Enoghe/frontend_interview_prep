      An accordion is a UI component that allows users to expand and collapse content sections. 
      It's used to present content in a compact form, making it easy to browse without overwhelming the user.

    title: "How Does an Accordion Work?",
    content: `
      An accordion works by showing only the titles of each section initially. When a title is clicked, 
      the content associated with that section expands, while the other sections collapse. This toggling behavior 
      helps in managing large amounts of content efficiently.
